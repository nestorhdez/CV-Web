# CV-Web

Last project made in the bootcamp 20H Talent. This is the implementation of everything learned to date with javascript, plus a test to strengthen teamwork with techniques such as scrum. The task assigned to our group, was to make a web application for desktop users with the aim of connecting people looking for employment in the world of web development with companies of the same. The layout of the site was done with bootstrap and using some css to make some changes and for the logic we have used Vanilla Javascript and Jquery.

On the homepage you can see a image slider on the top, two sections where is explained the service of the company and some links to some landing pages.

When you click on the *profiles button* of the navbar, the web lets you search among all user profiles. Also you can choose if you want a filter to that search. Clicking on the *search button*, the users profiles load and you are able to see more info, edit that info and delete the user.

If you go back to the homepage and then click on the *companies button* of the navbar, you are able to do the same interaction with the companies profiles.

On the *services* section of the main page, you can see two links: one to the alumns landing page and other to the companies one.
